Part 1: 
- For webstorm I went on the modules for the Jetbrains Webstorm student edition
  https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students
- I then applied for the educational pack https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students
- After confirming I am human I linked my github with webstorm to combine my work.
- Then I downloaded WebStorm and was able to transfer my VS code repositories to it immediately

GIT
- With Git I set it up through mac by sudo apt install git in my terminal
- Git is a version control system that keeps track of files

Github
-This is a website that has developers keep track of files of code through local repositories
-Prior to this class I had already created github by creating an account.
Part 2
**Branch** - Allows user to work on different parts of a project without affecting other parts.

**Clone** - Copies a repository from GitHub.com to your device

**Commit** - Records changes to one or more files in a branch

**Fetch** - Receive work done by other people from the repository

**GIT** - Version control system that tracks changes in files

**Github** - Website that helps developers store, manage and collaborate on projects of code

**Merge** - Allows you to take a branch and put combine it with another.

**Merge Conflict** - Two different branches of code have made changes simultaneously which prevents the files to be able to combine

**Push** - Used to upload content to the local repository

**Pull** - Used to fetch and download content from a remote repositoryand immediately update local repository to match

**Remote** - Place where the code is stored

**Repository** - Place that stores files, code and change history
