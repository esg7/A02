Part 1: 
- For webstorm I went on the modules for the Jetbrains Webstorm student edition
  https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students
- I then applied for the educational pack https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students
- After confirming I am human I linked my github with webstorm to combine my work.
- Then I downloaded WebStorm and was able to transfer my VS code repositories to it immediately

Part 2

**Github** - Website that helps developers store, manage and collaborate on projects of code

**Merge** - Allows you to take a branch and put combine it with another.

**Merge Conflict** - Two different branches of code have made changes simultaneously which prevents the files to be able to combine
